# Students Against Destructive Decisions (SADD) Website

## What is it?
Students Against Destructive Decisions, or SADD as I will refer to it for the rest of this ReadMe, is a nation-wide student organization that motivates
fellow students to avoid making damaging or destructive decisions and instead make healthy ones. I joined SADD as a member a few years back and loved what
the organization stood for. I wanted to help more than I was, and in my own way - so I made a website.

## Why?
My goal with making the website was to help spread the organizations goal and mission. I hope my website publicized it more and got people motivated
to if not join, then at least listen.

## Technical Time!
The website was made with a favorite of mine - the design first, code second approach. The design for all screen sizes was made in Figma before I started
coding the site. Then, I translated the design into HTML and CSS. Kinda. I used React and Tailwind as they are amazing tools for web development. There's a
more to it.
